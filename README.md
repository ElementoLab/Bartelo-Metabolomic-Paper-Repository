# Bartelo-Metabolomic-Paper-Repository
Contains notebooks and files needed to reproduce the findings from the publication. WARNING: SOME FILES WERE TOO LARGE TO BE INCLUDED ON GITHUB AND WILL HAVE TO BE CREATED USING THE UKBB DATA DIRECTLY OR REQUESTED FROM THE ELEMENTOLAB BY EMAILING NIB4003@MED.CORNELL.EDU!!!

# Data Files
Contains created dataframes and text files which we import in our notebooks to create our final cohorts and conduct analyses using these patients. 

# Analysis of GWAS.ipynb
Contains the analysis after the GWAS was performed.

# Demographics Analysis Of Progressors Vs Non-progressors and All Seven Pre-diabetic Groups.ipynb
Contains the age, sex, ethnicity, number, and statistical testing for these variables for progressors vs. non-progressors and pre-diabetic unsupervised clusters.

# Manually Created Figures - Bar charts, Networks, Dotplots, and Circular Plots.ipynb
Contains all figures created manually.

# Pre-diabetic Clustering and Statistical Analyses of Metabolomics, Comorbidities, Progression Outcomes, and Traditional Risk Factors.ipynb
Contains the actual clustering and numerous statistical analyses for the metabolomics, comorbidities, progression outcomes, and traditional risk factors. 

# Random Assignment of Pre-diabetics To Seven Groups.ipynb
Contains the method for randomly assigning patients to 7 groups and all statistical analyses conducted for these groups.

# Shows Group Of 5431 Pre-diabetic Patients Classified And 190 Patients With Diabetes At Recruitment.ipynb
Contains the data mining for the selection of pre-diabetics to be used in the study.

# Supervised Machine Learning Predicting Pre-diabetic Group Identity.ipynb
Contains all analyses for the supervised model created to predict a pre-diabetic assignment into their assigned group from the unsupervised clustering using the metabolomics data.
